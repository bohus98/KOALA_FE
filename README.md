## Issues/Improvements
# Clean the code
The code looks kinda messy, probably bc of Tailwind.
Use Bootstap next time?
# Conditional rendering
Adding conditional rendering to expand button.
It does not have to be rendered in rows without child data.
Also it would fix issue with expandind rows without child data.
# Proper delete handling
My delete function only works for parent data.
Would need to expand it to child as well.
Data is back after refreshing page.
also moving delete fuction into separete file would be nice.
# Creating DB and API
This could fix the code clarity issue.
Working with this type of nested data from json can be messy really quickly.
So having DB with 3 sepparate tables would be nice.
# Fixing Warnings
I have few warnings in my project, so it would be nice to fix them.
# Editing styles
App could use some better styling.
